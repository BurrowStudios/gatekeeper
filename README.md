# Gatekeeper

A permission service backend for Burrow Studios.

This service tracks entity ids and their associated permission overrides. It is built from the ground up to be
integrated into the [Burrow Studios architecture](https://github.com/BurrowStudios/api-docs), though the RESTful API can
also be used as a standalone service.


### ⚠️ Early development notice ⚠️

Please note that this application is still in early development and not officially supported until the first release.
